# Evox

Evox is a Voxel engine that I created using the Java programming language, along with powerful tools such as OpenGL and LWJGL. These resources empower Evox to produce captivating 3D graphics and interact smoothly with the computer's operating system and hardware.

The engine was heavily inspired by Minecraft and was created as a passion project.

A standout feature of Evox is its ability to create diverse and distinctive virtual environments. By utilizing Perlin noise algorithms, Evox offers each player a unique, immersive experience as they explore these algorithmically-generated worlds.

In the realm of multiplayer gaming, Evox excels thanks to its effective use of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is a standard technology I employed to ensure that all players' computers communicate efficiently. This adoption of TCP ensures a seamless multiplayer experience, with minimal lag or disruption.

Evox also introduces an engaging component of gameplay that allows players to manipulate their in-game world. Users can add or remove elements in the game environment much like handling building blocks, fostering an interactive and dynamic gaming experience. Coupled with an intuitive, user-friendly interface, this ensures players can engage with the game world effortlessly.

Furthermore, the player controls within Evox are straightforward and responsive. This design focus on easy navigation and interaction contributes to an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience.

Evox originated in 2014 as a personal hobby project, marking my inaugural dive into significant 3D projects. I primarily employed OpenGL 2.1, a specific version of the OpenGL tools, to construct Evox. Looking back, Evox stands as a milestone in my journey as a software developer, showcasing my growth and evolution in the field.
